        <h2>✨ HTML ✨</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>!Doctype - This is the first line of code that is needed for HTML documents. It tells the page how to format when its on different web browsers.</li>
            <li>lang="en" - This displays the language the document will be types and displayed in. In this example the language would be english.</li>
            <li>head - Every webpage has invisable ways of organizing information. The head is the top section of the webpage and holds imporant information; such as, the title, metadata, stylesheet, etc...</li>
            <li>meta - Also known as metadata are bits of data that describe the information on the webpage but are invisable on the display.</li>
            <li>header - As it sounds the header is another invisable format that is under the head. The header holds information like headings, logos, or text at the top of the page.</li>
            <li>title - The title is the word that appears when you open a webpage and its displayed on the tab on the top of the website.</li>
            <li>body - This iss another invisable element, the body is the bulk of the webpage and contains all information that is inside the webpage. Some examples are list, paragraphs, images, links, buttons, and etc...</li>
            <li>h1-h6 - The h represents headings that will be visable on the website. the number following it is 1 through 6. 1 being the largest font size the heading can be and 6 is the smallest heading font size. P.s the heading cannot go lower that h6 there is no h7.</li>
            <li>p - Paragraphs are typically a few sentences however in this context a paragraph can technically be any number of text. This element can be used for sigular words, sentences, or full paragraphs.</li>
            <li>ul - This is an un-ordered list meaning that its not in any particular order.</li>
            <li>ol - This is an ordered list meaning it goes in numarical order from 1 to whenever the list ends. aka 1, 2, 3, and so on.</li>
            <li>li - This simply means list and what is the difference between li and ul? It's the bullet points. ul has no indicatior of order where as a li element has black dots by defult showing where each point starts.</li>
            <li>img - is for an image, picture, gif.</li>
            <li>a href="x" - this is a format for enbedding links into the webpage wheather is internal or external links the format works for both.</li>
            <li>footer - This is the bottom section of the invisable organizational elements. The footer holds information like the JavaScript link, last paragrpahs for the page, etc...</li>
            <li>sections - Sections are like the padding, and the margins there is more but essensially its for making the formatting more intuitive and less smashed together.</li>
            <li>div - This is a type of selector and basically groups things together so that way they are easy to find and don't effect other elements on the webpage.</li>
            <li>br - This is considered "white space" also known as a page break. The computer doesn't care how aestetically information is spaced. As humans however it would be very difficult to read lines of code with no spacing hence why page break is on this list.</li>
            <li>HTML - Is an acryomn for Hyper Text Markup Language and in the anaglogy of building a house; it would be considered the structure or the base.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>✨ CSS ✨</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>div - This is a type of selector as covered in html notes. An example would be div(dog: brown; cat: grey;). the div keeps them seperate but grouped together.</li>
          <li>property - The property is the 'what' in the example above what is brown? the dog. Properties are important because they allow us to modify the 'what'.</li>
          <li>value - In the prior example is the color grey the cat is? Grey we added more value to the property</li>
          <li>declaration - The declaration is both the property and the value together its been delcared. I declar that the dog is brown and the cat is grey following along with the example above.</li>
          <li>, - Commas are imporant because they allow us to seperate different elements but still allow them to share the same piece of code. This way we don't have to type in the same lines reapeatably. A new example header, footer: pink; in this example the header and the footer would both be pink even though they are in different sections and aren't connected. </li>
          <li>CSS - This acryonm is Cascading Style Sheet and its used to make the website visually appealing. In the analogy of the house html would be the structure and css would be the paint and furniture.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>✨ Git ✨</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>pwd - Another acryomn meaning Print Working Directory. This lets us check where in the file in our command line is currently at.</li>
          <li>ls - This is for list but not the same ones from the HTML section. This is a list of all the files that are currently in the folder or directory.</li>
          <li>directory - We hear this word a bunch. A directory is where data is stored. A new exapmle I have a folder called desktop, inside is another folder called pictures, and inside the pictures folder I have saved photos. The directory allows us to find photos by saying go to desktop/picutres/photos and then we made it to where the photos are.</li>
          <li>cd - change directory now the directory if data in folders so cd will let us chage what folders we are in to see different data that is there aka the photos from the exapmle above..</li>
          <li>cd .. - This is to go back one step, note its cd space .. not cd.. also  this only works for directorys it will not change or go back to a prior branch.</li>
          <li>mkdir - To make new directory aka make a new folder. P.S make sure when you create a new directory that you are inside the correct folders before creating it or it'll be lost on the computer and you'll have to go digging to find it.</li>
          <li>git status - To check what branch you are actively working on and where in the directory it is, as well as what branch you are in.</li>
          <li>git add -A - This command is to stage the new changes. P.S it will not save them with only this command but its the first step to saving your changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "x" - This command is to add a message to the new changes. NOTE: if git takes you to a new screen that starts with the word MERGE and is yellow follow these steps so get out without corrupting the file. First click i on the keyboard, next type in the comment, then click ctrl + c, and finally type in qa! (you'll see it at the bottom of the screen) click enter and it will take you back to the correct screen.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main - This command will show you all the current revisions youve made to the directory you are working on. Always pull before pushing so you know its the correct files. NOTE (IF YOU RENAMED THE MAIN IN YOUR DIRECTORY TYPE WHATEVER THE NEW NAME IS INSTEAD OF MAIN... your welcome.) </li>
          <li>git push feature/branch-name - THis command is used for adding the new changes that you've added, commited/messaged, to the main branch.</li>
          <li>git checkout main - This will take me back to the main branch from whatever branch I was currently working in.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b feature/branch-name -  To creates a new branch. </li>
          <li>branch - This is a term we use alot it basically means working on a sub copy that you can later add to the main project.</li>
          <li>git checkout feature/branch-name - This is basically the cd command from above however its used only for moving between branches not data. For example if im in the feature/name branch and I need to go back to main brach cd won't work. Neither will cd .. because they are for folders and data not branches. </li>

        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>✨ Javascript ✨</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>variables - The variable command can be changed later on as long as its not const. For example letmyvarible="bob" can be written as myvariable="joe" later on.</li>
         <li>const - This command means that whatever comes after it will be consistent throughout the webpage and cannot be changed later on without changing the original value.</li>
         <li>strings - A string is a group of letters aka words or phrases. They always have quotation marks surrounding them as in the example above with joe and bob.</li>
         <li>numbers - This commad usually don't have quotes around them and can be any number within the gigabytes range if bigger or smaller than the gigabytes range, then the system cannot calculate every number.</li>
         <li>boolean - A command that means is it true or false.</li>
         <li>arrays - Allows us to store data in little "boxes" to help us quickly identify them later on.</li>
         <li>int - An int stands for an interger which means only one character/ letter.</li>
         <li>/* x */ - This is the basic format in VS code to comments inside the coding plateform so it won't be seen by the users but only by those who are looking at the raw code.</li>
         <li>+ - This one is for addition.
         <li>- - This is subtraction.</li>
         <li>* - This is what we use for multiplication.</li>
         <li>/ - That symbol is use for division.</li>
         <li>= - This is to assign something any value, property, etc... for example the variable x = 0 meaning that we assigned 0 to the value of x.</li>
         <li>=== - This would be considered 'truthy' basically its really close to being a true statement but is not exactly 100% true. It's the truth to a degree or close enough to being true.</li>
         <li>! or !== - Similarly to the truthy, non-equal is basically correct in the fact that it's not equal to a degree.</li>
         <li>function - Looks usually like a variable however it is followed by () in most cases.</li>
         <li>anonymous functions - This is a function that is followed by ()=> instead of just ()</li>
        </ul>
