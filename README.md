## Why did I make this Project?
This was a project inspired by being a coding student. I wanted a place to keep my notes. My goal was not only to make the notes easy to read but also personalize it so it's not just some exact copy on the materials I've been learning. My motivation at first was truthfully to finish this project. However as I continuously messed up, lost files, corrupted documents, and really thought that wasn't ready for this it became a challege. I wanted to know more and to understand why these mistakes where happening.Soon after I really enjoyed this project.

 ## Problems that occured and solutions?
 Here some problems that I encountered and how I resolved them.The first problem was not realizing that git add -A doesn't automatically save the project. I then properly learned how to save my project the correct way.

 Then I had a lot of trouble with corrupting my files because I just closed out the git commit message screen thinking it would be okay and wasn't able to figureout how to uncorrupt the files. The solution I deleted everything and started over for a third time.(Yes, I corrupted my project 3 times and yes redid this 3 times.) I did manage to figure out how to properly exit the screen after that. (Thank you Coffee Programmer!)
 
  Last major problem I ran into was I saved my main branch incorrectly and kept losing files so I made a new one and revised it to be main-best. It did take me hours to figure out if you rename the branch you also have to type the new name when you use git pull.

## Usage

Its only a visual site for the moment and is non interactive.To open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics I learned from the prework.
